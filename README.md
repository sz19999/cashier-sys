## C Console Bookstore Cashier System
This is an academic project developed as a final assignment for the Advanced C Programming Lab course at HIT College.
The cashier system is implemented purely in C and runs as a command-line console application. It allows users to:
*Log in securely
*Track inventory
*Manipulate inventory (e.g., add/delete items, sell/return books)

# Development Environment
*Built using Visual Studio 2022
*The project can be cloned, compiled, and run directly within Visual Studio
*Alternatively, you can download the src/, inc/, and build/ directories separately and compile the project manually with a C compiler
