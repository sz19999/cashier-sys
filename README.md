# C Console Bookstore Cashier System
This is an academic project developed as a final assignment for the Advanced C Programming Lab course at HIT College.
The cashier system is implemented purely in C and runs as a command-line console application. It allows users to:
* Log in
* Track inventory
* Manipulate inventory (e.g., add/delete items, sell/return)

## Development Environment
* Built using Visual Studio 2022
* The project can be cloned as is, compiled, and run directly within Visual Studio
* Alternatively, you can download the src/, inc/, and build/ directories separately and compile the project manually with a C compiler
* When running first time, an admin user is created (username: admin, password: 12345678). after loggin for the first time, you can add other users.
* ***Important***: To run the .exe file after building, execute the program from project root folder (e.g., run build\Final_Project.exe from the project root folder) to ensure file paths resolve correctly
