This is an academic project that was built as a final project for the course "Advanced C Programming Lab" in "HIT" College.

* The project was built in "Visual Studio 2022", it can be directly cloned, compiled and ran inside Visual Studio. for other alternatives just download the src, inc and build directories, then compile and run.
